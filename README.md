## Voice Quality Levels

Voices come in different quality levels, which affect both the speech quality and resource usage:

- **x_low**: Smallest models, fastest processing, lowest quality
- **low**: Small models, fast processing, decent quality
- **medium**: Balanced models, good quality with reasonable resource usage
- **high**: Largest models, highest quality, but more resource-intensive
